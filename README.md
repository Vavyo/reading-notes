# Reading Notes

A place for me, Nathan, to keep my reading notes from Delta V

## Code 102 - Intro to Software Development

This is where I would have shown off 102 stuff like `print "Hello World"` and such but didnt take the class

## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development

## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) should have been my friend

## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

I'll be using [Links](README.md) to navigate later.

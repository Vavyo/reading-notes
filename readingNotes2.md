# Unit Tests & Documentation

## Unit Tests
Unit tests are great. 
They are ways to make sure your methods are working as intended. 
Each test should focus on a single method with a single assert. 
First you need to set up all supporting elements needed for the method, then you can run the method, and then you can use assert to determine if it was successful. 
Once a suite of tests is done its a good idea to add it in the project build.

## Documentation
A readme should be as short as possible without missing anything. Extra details can be added on extra pages referenced by the readme. They should contain information on setup, description, dependency, and use.

[This Template](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/blob/master/README-default.md) is a great source of a readme template.
